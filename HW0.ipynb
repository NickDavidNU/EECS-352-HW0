    "## Overview\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to set up your development environment and to familiarize you with some of the Python packages you will be using this quarter. We will be using Jupyter notebooks (previously known as IPython notebooks) for homeworks this quarter. The homeworks will be distributed as notebooks and you will submit them as notebooks—in fact, what you are reading now is a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to hand in\n",
    "You are to submit the following things for this homework:\n",
    "1. A Jupyter notebook containing all code and output (figures and audio). I should be able to evaluate the file to reproduce all output. \n",
    "1. Any other data that we tell you to save to a file (e.g. audio files).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: To make sure that when I reevaluate your code it generates the output you expect, it's good practice to restart the Jupyter Python kernel, clear all output, and then run all cells again. Since cells can be run in any order and deleted, etc., it's easy for you to accidentally break your code and not realize it... :/\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to hand it in\n",
    "To submit your lab:\n",
    "1. Compress all of the files specified into a .zip file. \n",
    "1. Name the file in the following manner, firstname_lastname_hw0.zip. For example, Bryan_Pardo_hw0.zip. \n",
    "1. Submit this .zip file via Canvas"

    "\n",
    "### Create a Conda environment for the class\n",
